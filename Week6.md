I decided to explore the Boys Will Be Boys Newsletter that operated out of Sydeny Australia in the early 1990s. The 8 issues explored the FtM experience, and included reflections from regular contributors, as well as letters to the editor from various readers. The collections was provided to the Digital Transgender ARchive by the Sexual Minorities Archives.

I used WGET to download the files from the site, which was troublesome at first since the urls were not incremented so I had to manually gather the list of urls into a urls.txt which I then used wget to download them responsibly. Then I had to convert them all to .pdf since they saved as just a file.  From there I copy and pasted the text from the pdf files into .txt files and then used Voyant and AntConc to analyze them. I had to copy and paste the text as the layout of the text would have rendered the OCR results jumbled which would not have worked for the text analysis I had planned.
