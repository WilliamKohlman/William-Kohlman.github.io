I decided to explore the Boys Will Be Boys Newsletter that operated out of Sydeny Australia in the early 1990s. The 8 issues explored the FtM experience, and included reflections from regular contributors, as well as letters to the editor from various readers. The collections was provided to the Digital Transgender ARchive by the Sexual Minorities Archives.

I coopy and pasted the text from the pdf files into .txt files and then used Voyant and AntConc to analyze them.
