## Conclusion

After using WGET to download the documents, I was able to do some exploratory analysis on the text of the "Boys Will be Boys Newsletter" of the early 90s that originated out of Australia. Using Voyant, I was able to examine the most used terms, their co-occurrance with each other, and as well as their relative use in each document. Using Voyant I was able to narrow my focus to how "FtM" and "Gender" were used, which I explored using AntConc. Using AntConc, I saw that "FtM" was often used to refer to other organisations, groups, communnities, and newsletters. This means that those in this sphere were recommending other similar groups to one another to grow their networks and support each other. Similarly, the use of "Gender" indicated that Gender Issues and how other groups handled and discussed them were a primary point of discussion in this newsletter.

To take this research futher, more newsletters would need to be required, and/or someone could focus on different words and how they influenced the text. If more documents were acquired over a longer period of time, a researcher could analyze how their vocabulary and use of terms changed over time. Someone who was interested in the how far reaching the network of this newsletter was could spend the time to codify the various letters, contributers, and columns and separate and clean the text to do a proper network analysis on. There would probably be a few core nodes, likely the main editors and contributors, but it could be interesting to see how frequent people contributed, and from how far away this newsletter spread in the FtM community of the early 1990s.
